Math-Seminar-Project--Terrain-Generation
========================================
The Maple code was written for Maple 16, and has not been tested for backwards compatibility.

Execute make three times to build the paper from scratch the first time. Execute once from then on, except twice when references change. You can also use external TeX editors (such as TeXShop), but please remember to exclude intermediate build files from the repository.
