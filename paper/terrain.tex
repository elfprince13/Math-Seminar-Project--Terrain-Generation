    \maketitle

     \begin{abstract}
     In this paper we present various methods of fractal terrain generation. We discuss the relative advantages and disadvantages of each method. Methods presented include: midpoint displacement, Fourier space manipulation of gaussian noise, multi fractal methods, and their respective variations.
